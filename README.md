Node.js/Express app that serves as a backend for the preptime analyzer web application.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the resources and instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, and also with notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To get the project started, there are some tools you need to install on your local machine. The list of tools you need to install have been provided with a guide on how to install these tools.

* Install git

For users on Mac, the best way to install git is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). To install Homebrew, open your shell and run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After the command is done running, check if Homebrew is successfully installed by running:

```
brew --version
```

If Homebrew is successfully installed, the version will be logged to the screen. Now proceed to install git using Homebrew with the following command:

```
brew install git
```

For users on Windows, download the [latest version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) of Git and choose the 64/32 bit version. After the file is downloaded, install it in the system.
